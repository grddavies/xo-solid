# xo-solid

## Overview

`xo-solid` is a tic-tac-toe (Noughts & Crosses) web game built using [SolidJS](solidjs.com) based on the [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## Dev

Dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/).

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
pnpm install # or npm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm run dev` or `pnpm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `pnpm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.

It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
